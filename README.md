# Guess the TF2 Map

Given an image of a TF2 map, guess which one it is.

# TODO

- Get a new random question on each guess
- Should probably just remove score and tell the user if they got the question correct or not.
- Implement data structures to hold images to guess on and their answers
- Add pop up for when all questions are completed
